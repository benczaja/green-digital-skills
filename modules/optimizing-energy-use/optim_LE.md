## Good software practice

Clean and maintainable software is essential
to sustainable/green software:
 - ease of use, reduce error during data settings
 - less bugs, avoid wasteful bugged runs

## Software life cycle

Thinking about long term sustainability, documentation.
Reusable software is a key component of modern
software development, reducing the time/energy consuming
task of developing every component of complex softwares.

## Energy usage

Energy is power * time -> as first approximation,
more efficient (faster) software will be energy efficient.

A note on parallelism and scaling issue.

## Right tool for each task

Are there slow programming languages that should be
avoided ?
 - each tool has it's purpose.
Python: great for stitching pieces together, easy prototyping
C/C++/Fortran: better at crunching number fast, but not
so good at doing string manipulation, ...

Benchmark available in the litterature can be missleading.

-> Use the right tool for each task (could simply be the 
tool you're confortable with), blending languages
when necessary.
