* How do I measure how much energy I am using?
* Does this correspond to the real usage?
* Does making my code more time-efficient mean it's greener? 
* What programming language should I choose?
* What are some best practices for green coding?
* What do I do if I don't develop the code (or for whatever reason can't modify it)?
