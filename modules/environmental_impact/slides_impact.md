## The Carbon Cost

Note:

Many disasters, such as the 2019-2020 Australian bushfires, are increasing in frequency and intensity due to climate change.

This is mostly driven by increases in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide and methane gas

The electricity we use to power our computing can be generated in many ways, some more carbon intensive than others

Note:

Climate change is not the only environmental cost

Mining for raw materials and industrial processes involved in hardware manufacturing are responsible for a lot of pollution

Water usage in energy production or in cooling systems for computing clusters
